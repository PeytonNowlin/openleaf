# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those
roles to the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), use the
corresponding label string from this table.

Edit the right-hand column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use.

## Which of these exist on GitHub today

`wontfix` already exists on `PeytonNowlin/openleaf`. The other four do not, and
`gh issue edit --add-label` fails on a label that does not exist rather than
creating one. Create them once:

```sh
gh label create needs-triage   --description "Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue"
gh label create needs-info     --description "Waiting on reporter for more information"
gh label create ready-for-agent --description "Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent"
gh label create ready-for-human --description "Requires human implementation"
```

These are orthogonal to the `area:` and `priority:` labels the repo already
uses; a triaged issue normally carries one of each.
